Name: Cash Flow Statement Report
Description: A simple Cash Flow Statement.
 Cash Flow statement would be done with the bank and cash accounts setup.
 It will receive all the cash receipts minus the cash payments for each account.
 The balance would be you positive or negative cash flow.
 This is not sales on credit or purchases on credit.
 These will only reflect when you receive payment on those sales or when you pay your supplier.
 Each account will then have an opening and closing balance and the difference would be you negative or positive cash flow.
