Package: import_multijournalentries
Version: 2.3.0-7
Name: Import Multiple Journal Entries
Description: This extension imports CSV files of the following format:
 entryid, date, reference, accountcode, dimension1, dimension2, amount, memo
 - 'entryid' can be any value, so long as it differs from all other entryids
 in the import file.  Every entryid will result in a separate journal entry
 being created with the specified transaction data within it.
 Transactions with the same entryid must be grouped together within the
 import file.
 - 'date' and 'reference' should be the same throughout a given entry.
 - For proper use of all of these fields (except 'entryid'), see the
 Journal Entry entry dialog within FrontAccounting under Banking and
 General Ledger.
 - entryid does *not* correspond to what the journal entry id will be within
 FrontAccounting.
